0	sure, but that's not the choice.	"originally, Syracuse was a potential location for Cornell University but Ezra adamantly hated Syracuse so he chose to place the school in Ithaca. How would you feel if Cornell had been in Syracuse instead?

3	okay, thank you!	okay thank you- is there a specific part of my application that makes me a reach (so is there anything I can do to better my chances of getting in so that UCB is a match) or are these schools just too competitive to be matches for anyone but the absolute best?	I would not worry about your course load affecting your admissions, but ofc everyone looks at it differently. I definitely think you are Regents material especially for Berkeley because I really think they are looking for fit. UC's were brutal last year but I think Berkeley hasn't changed much compared to the rest of the UCs. Good luck, you're already amazing! message me any time if you consider the UC's for help, I was a Berkeley Regents Candidate.	e04viek	e04u5nn	e04sjb8	[deleted]	[deleted]	secretgeek69	8olwwk	8olwwk	8olwwk	ApplyingToCollege	ApplyingToCollege	ApplyingToCollege	1

5	"&gt; Nah, was thinking more of like, 'upper-middle' tier houses (as long as they're not buttmad about being 'on the rise').
&gt; 
&gt; Rush is really simple - houses have open events, you go to them, meet as many people as you can and establish some friendly relationships (if you vibe with the people you're talking to), and that's it.
&gt; 
&gt; You don't have to prove your cool or anything - each house has like, a 'culture' and if you get along with that you're fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the top houses generally have an idea on who they're going to fill up their pledge class with before formal rush though because of already existing relationships (guys older brother is a senior, or someone knows incoming freshman from HS, etc.). So if you are really going to gun for a top house or something ask your cousin to bring you to some parties/kickbacks so you can meet some brothers before you're allowed to rush (spring of freshman year)

My cousin is graduating in June, and she's a girl. But like, is there any way to go to these kickbacks/parties solo?

I heard what you said about Top rush from other people, but I heard that it's possible to get in even if you're not in that category.



FWIW, I spend every other day M,W,F, at a local community college taking courses. And the girls in my cousin's sorority are just as hot.

6	"&gt;  I think ILR/AEM/Hotel has a ton of people in Greek life, which might explain the whiteness + appearance of wealth

This makes no sense to me. Maybe because I'm not yet at Cornell, but what does participation in Greek life have to do with being white? Uh, are P.O.C excluded from frats? The kid who was leading my tour at Cornell was the president of a fraternity, and he was black. Maybe I misunderstood you. 

And fraternities are determined by familial wealth? That sucks because one of the things I most looked forward to was Greek life .. When I went to visit, my guide said that the top fraternities take anyone, ""as long as they're cool"", but I guess there's some coded language in that"	Because part of the rushing process is they're going to want to follow you on Instagram.

"&gt; My father was a DU way back when, so obviously my info is outdated for frats, but my sister is in a sorority at Cornell. They have a certain type of person they want. Social media plays a part in confirming/denying that.

What kind of person? If you don't mind me asking..

And my cousin who goes to Cornell now is also in a sorority (Alpha Phi). She's graduating this year tho :(, and she met her BF at Cornell. "	duquqw6	duudwat	duv9mph	KentuckyJew01	Seylliani	KentuckyJew01	7zmvva	7zmvva	7zmvva	Cornell	Cornell	Cornell	0
